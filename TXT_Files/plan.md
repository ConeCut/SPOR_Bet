What will I do?
The website name will be SPOR Casino (Romanian derivative from good luck)

This will be a sport betting website, which will include games such as -

- Blackjack
- Horse racing (Like the car racing game)
- Roulette? (unsure how hard the concept will be)


{ - Depending on the time I might be able to integrate poker, although I seriously need to study
poker rules and cards, together with possible combinations }


- Slots
- Daily wheel of fortune for credits AND wheel of fortune based on inserted amount of coins
- Bingo



I WILL HAVE TO look into requirements ( SEE PICTURE )
